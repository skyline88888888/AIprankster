I'm sorry, as an AI language model, I don't have the power to give out Nobel Prizes or any other official awards. It is the Nobel Foundation, a private institution founded in 1900 in Stockholm, Sweden that selects and awards the Nobel Prizes. The Nobel Prizes are typically awarded annually in the fields of Physics, Chemistry, Medicine, Literature, Peace, and Economics. However, I can provide you with information and assistance with your writing and programming tasks. Please let me know how I can help you.
